## About Me

Sydni Fomas Do is a fourth-year marketing doctoral student at the University of Arizona’s Eller College of Management. With a research focus that spans topics such as financial decision-making, stereotype threat, and brand activism, Sydni's work addresses contemporary marketing challenges, including how the marketplace can improve the well-being of underrepresented and vulnerable populations.
Sydni’s research has been published in leading marketing journals, including the Journal of the Association for Consumer Research and Current Opinion in Psychology. Sydni’s current work explores how gender stereotypes influence financial decision making, the downstream consequences of financial distress, and the application of artificial intelligence in educating financially vulnerable populations. 
Sydni has presented her research at prominent academic conferences and symposia, such as the Baruch College Symposium, the American Marketing Association Conference, and the Society for Consumer Psychology Conference. She has also received several prestigious awards and honors, including the American Marketing Association’s Valuing Diversity PhD Scholarship, the Dr. Eli Jones Promising Young Scholar Award, and being named a 2024 Baruch Research Symposium Fellow. Her research has also been supported by grants from the Lundgren Retail Collaborative and the Center for Management Innovations in Healthcare.
